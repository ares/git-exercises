## Task #2 - update this readme

hints:
* you have to add files to stage before you create a commit
* you can always see status by running `git status`
* `git add .` stages all your changes
* `git commit` opens your default editor so you can set commit message, after saving and quiting the editor, commit is created
* if this repository was created by cloning you can easily push the change back by `git push origin master`
